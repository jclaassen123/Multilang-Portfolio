Portfolio Overview:

This portfolio showcases my exploration of three programming languages: Python, Kotlin, and Go.
For each language, I have developed projects in three different formats:
_______________________________________________
Text-based – command-line or console applications
GUI-based – interactive desktop applications
Web-based – web applications and services

Some projects are variations on the same concept across languages, while others are entirely unique, resulting in a total of nine projects that demonstrate versatility, problem-solving, and adaptability across different programming paradigms and platforms.
